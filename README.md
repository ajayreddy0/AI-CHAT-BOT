# AI-CHAT-BOT
An AI chatbot is an application program that employs artificial intelligence (AI) to mimic human conversations. It utilizes natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to recognize, process, and answer user questions in real-time.
	
AI chatbots are extensively used in all sectors, such as customer care, medicine, online shopping, and education, to offer automated support and enhance user interaction. As opposed to conventional rule-based chatbots, AI chatbots learn from conversation, identify intent, and create context-specific responses, thus being intelligent and efficient.

This project delves into the creation of an AI chatbot based on data science techniques and algorithms, with an emphasis on NLP, deep learning, and cloud deployment to develop a smart conversation.
